## DRAFT GUIDANCE - OPEN FOR FEEDBACK

This framework has been designed to help you make decisions about quality of data for statistics. It groups the quality assessment into two phases: input and output quality.  

The __input__ quality assesses the data you have coming in the door; how suitable is it for what you want to do with it?  

The __output__ quality assesses the quality of the statistics or analysis you have produced; how well does it meet you and your usersâ€™ needs?  

Both phases use quality dimensions to help you prioritise and assess different aspects of fitness for use. Quality dimensions are characteristics of the data and output which may be important to you and your users. Very rarely will there be an output or dataset which is completely perfect. Identifying the dimensions which are important for you helps you to make decisions about how fit for purpose your data and output are. As the purpose of the data and output are different (one is to be processed, the other published and shared), the dimensions are slightly different across the phases.

Within each section is a description of the dimensions of quality and challenges for each when using administrative data. There are also some questions and tools to guide you through deciding whether this aspect of quality is important for your purpose. Finally, there is an introduction to assessing that dimension of quality, with some links to in-depth methods. For brevity and to prevent duplication, these have not been directly included here. If you would like them to be, please email DQHub@ons.gov.uk 

The purpose of this framework is not to answer these questions for you, but to point you towards what you should be thinking about (and doing) in order to understand whether your data and/or your output is fit for use.  

There are often multiple approaches to answering/addressing these questions. This may involve liaising with others within (or outside) your organisation such as data owners to find the answer to a question, accessing and exploring the metadata, or exploring aspects of the dataset/output yourself.  

It is important to have open discussions with your users during this process about their needs. No dataset or output is perfect, but the most crucial element is transparent and clear communication with your users about the data you had, what you did with it, and what that means in terms of quality. This allows the person who is using that statistic to use it in a way which is informed, and any decisions they make with it to include important context.
